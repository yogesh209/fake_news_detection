The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["true.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"bR3LP7WfKCNR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1723324847915,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":618,"user":{"displayName":"Yogesh Yadav (M21PH209)","userId":"14806401411512819383"}},"outputId":"776d9a4a-e721-48f4-b513-8b1fed14a963"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(21417, 4)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["fake.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":293},"id":"aEzEqyQKJ4i8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1723324852162,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":597,"user":{"displayName":"Yogesh Yadav (M21PH209)","userId":"14806401411512819383"}},"outputId":"3b34e6f4-a915-4ddd-b0e1-a60b0cfdc68a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               title  \\\n","0   Donald Trump Sends Out Embarrassing New Year’...   \n","1   Drunk Bragging Trump Staffer Started Russian ...   \n","2   Sheriff David Clarke Becomes An Internet Joke...   \n","3   Trump Is So Obsessed He Even Has Obama’s Name...   \n","4   Pope Francis Just Called Out Donald Trump Dur...   \n","\n","                                                text subject  \\\n","0  Donald Trump just couldn t wish all Americans ...

According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via

I think we should go back and look at what Don Jr. and Eric have done and wanted to continue to do, which is raise money for charities,  Conway remarked in an attempt to evade Cuomo s question about the illegal scheme.  The Eric Trump Foundation is 10 years old. It has done enormously great work. Cuomo pointed out that Conway herself whined when Clinton s team made the same argument. It s the same thing the Clinton people said when they were defending their allegations of pay-for-play. They (Eric and Donald Jr.) were selling off a million dollar trip to hunt with the boys and hang out with the president. That sounds like paying for access. But Conway dodged again by throwing out the same accusations and attacks against the Clinton s that have been repeatedly debunked. I don t know how that s the same as Bill Clinton giving a million dollar speech in Russia and then Hillary Clinton, while secretary of state, turning around and giving 20 percent of the U.S. uranium interests away,  Conway claimed. But that tall tale was rated false back in June.Then Cuomo grilled Conway.CUOMO:  So paying a million dollars to hang out with the president is okay? CONWAY:  I didn t say that. CUOMO:  I know, you re not answering. You re going after the Clintons. I m saying, what s your answer? CONWAY:  You mentioned the Clinton Foundation, you said it s the same. I m saying it s absolutely not the same. Then Cuomo dropped the hammer. You re giving the same defense that they gave. When you made the allegations against the Clintons, they said,  We do lots of great work. We took these meetings. There s never been a direct connection between what she did at the [state department] and what was going on at the foundation.  You re now saying basically the same thing.  Eric Trump does great work with his foundation and paying a lot of money to hang out with the president is okay.  If it s all okay, why are they backing away? Conway then whined that the media isn t treating Trump and his family fairly, which has been the main strategy when they are caught being hypocrites.Here s the video via YouTube.Eric Trump and his unfortunately named brother clearly knew what they were doing was wrong and that they were going to get busted running a pay-for-play scheme. That s the only reason why they backed out. And Kellyanne Conway knows it, which is why her defense was so pathetic. Whining about the media and attacking the Clintons have become the standard rules whenever Trump or his family members are busted doing something wrong. One still wonders how Conway can sleep at night or look at herself in the mirror every morning knowing that she is defending Satan and his demon spawn.Featured image via screenshot\",\n          \"It seemed like it took exactly 30 seconds for every person on the right-wing to take Hillary Clinton s early departure from a 9/11 memorial as proof that she is suffering from some severe medical disorder. In reality, Clinton did actually become overheated. Her medical doctor released a statement that explains that Clinton is currently suffering from pneumonia. It explains why she has been coughing on the campaign trail and why she needed to leave the event she was attending in New York.Politico reports that Clinton s physician, Lisa Bardack released a statement saying: Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies. On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this morning s event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely. Shocking. It s almost as if Clinton is a human being who gets sick. Pneumonia can, of course, turn deadly. However, given the medical miracles of the modern age, she ll probably be fine.  Just as Clinton s doctor, who you know, actually has a medical degree, and who examined her just today after the incident says she will be.Thanks to right-wing blowhards such as Sean Hannity, this bizarre health conspiracy has gone totally mainstream. It really says a lot about the power that the right-wing has harnessed when it comes to the media, both in traditional and online formats. They managed to turn a brief clip of Clinton falling while being rushed into a car into absolute proof that Clinton is suffering from Alzheimer s disease or whatever they believe she has this week.Welcome to the era of Alex Jones-like mass media speculation.Featured image from  Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said before a visit to India next week that the Trump administration wanted to \\u201cdramatically deepen\\u201d cooperation with New Delhi, seeing it as a key partner in the face of negative Chinese influence in Asia. Speaking on Wednesday, less than a month before President Donald Trump is due to make his first state visit to China, Tillerson said the United States had begun to discuss creating alternatives to Chinese infrastructure financing in Asia. In another comment likely to upset Beijing, he said Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation, something Beijing has opposed as an attempt by democracies to gang up on it. The remarks coincide with the start of a week-long Chinese Communist Party congress at which President Xi Jinping is seeking to further consolidate his power. \\u201cThe United States seeks constructive relations with China, but we will not shrink from China\\u2019s challenges to the rules-based order and where China subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends,\\u201d Tillerson told the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. \\u201cIndia and the United States should be in the business of equipping other countries to defend their sovereignty, build greater connectivity, and have a louder voice in a regional architecture that promotes their interests and develops their economies,\\u201d Tillerson added. The U.S. decision to expand relations with India almost certainly will upset India\\u2019s rival, Pakistan, where Tillerson also will stop next week, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Pakistan was the main U.S. ally in South Asia for decades, but U.S. officials are frustrated with what they charge has been Pakistan\\u2019s failure to cut support for the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, where the administration wants India to play a bigger role in economic development. As part of a South Asia strategy unveiled by Trump in August, Tillerson is expected to press Islamabad, which denies aiding the Taliban, to take stronger steps against extremists and allied groups and intensify efforts to pressure them to agree to peace talks with Kabul. \\u201cWe expect Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorist groups based there that threaten its own people and the broader region,\\u201d Tillerson said. Trump has threatened further cuts in U.S. aid to Pakistan if it fails to cooperate. China, a strategic rival to the United States and India, is also vital to Trump\\u2019s efforts to roll back North Korea\\u2019s efforts to create nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the United States, an issue expected to top the agenda in Trump\\u2019s Nov. 8-10 Beijing visit. A senior State Department official defended the timing of the speech, saying Tillerson also said he wanted a constructive relationship with China. \\u201cFor many decades the United States has supported China\\u2019s rise,\\u201d said the official. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve also supported India\\u2019s rise. But those two countries have risen very differently.\\u201d In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China hoped the United States could abandon bias when viewing its actions overseas. \\u201cChina will never develop itself at the expense of other countries,\\u201d Lu told a regular briefing on Thursday. \\u201cAt the same time we will never give up our justly deserved rights and interests.\\u201d  Healthy relations between China and the United States are good for the people of both countries and are expected by the Asia-Pacific region, he added. Tillerson did not say what he meant by creating an alternative to Chinese infrastructure financing, but said the Trump administration had begun a \\u201cquiet conversation\\u201d with some emerging East Asian democracies at a summit in August. He said Chinese financing was saddling countries with \\u201cenormous\\u201d debts and failing to create jobs. \\u201cWe think it\\u2019s important that we begin to develop some means of countering that with alternative financing measures.\\u201d \\u201cWe will not be able to compete with the kind of terms that China offers, but countries have to decide what are they willing to pay to secure their sovereignty and their future control of their economies and we\\u2019ve had those discussions with them as well,\\u201d he said. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
